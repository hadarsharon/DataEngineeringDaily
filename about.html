<h1>Background</h1>
<p>
    Data Engineering Daily, operating since 2016, is a primarily data-oriented technology news website, founded with the goal
    of being the leading source for Data-related news, as well as providing guides, tutorials and other supplementary
    orientation material for aspiring & experienced Data Engineers alike.
    <br>
    Since the site's inception, we have been active in promoting and covering numerous Data Engineering and/or Open Source related conferences -
    namely:&nbsp;
    <a href="http://ieee-icde.org/">The IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</a>,&nbsp;
    <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit</a> (formerly known as LinuxCon), and&nbsp;
    <a href="https://www.devconf.info/">DevConf</a>, among others.
    <br>
    Perhaps more importantly - site readers are also encouraged to apply their knowledge and contribute to Open Source
    Data-related projects!&nbsp;
    <br>
    Some well-known examples of aforementioned projects include:&nbsp;
    <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>,&nbsp;
    <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/">Great Expectations</a> and&nbsp;
    <a href="https://julialang.org/">the Julia Programming Language</a>).
