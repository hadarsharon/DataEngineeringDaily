                Data Engineering Daily, operating since 2016, is a primarily data-oriented technology news website,
                founded with the goal of being the leading source for Data-related news, as well as providing guides,
                tutorials and other supplementary orientation material for aspiring & experienced Data Engineers alike.
                <br>
                Since the site's inception, we have been active in promoting and covering numerous Data Engineering
                and/or Open Source related conferences - namely:&nbsp;
                <a href="http://ieee-icde.org/">The IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</a>,&nbsp;
                <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit</a> (formerly
                known as LinuxCon), and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.devconf.info/">DevConf</a>, among others.
                <br>
                Perhaps more importantly - site readers are also encouraged to apply their knowledge and contribute to
                Open Source Data-related projects!&nbsp;
                <br>
                Some well-known examples of aforementioned projects include:&nbsp;
                <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>,&nbsp;
                <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/">Great Expectations</a> and&nbsp;
                <a href="https://julialang.org/">the Julia Programming Language</a>).
