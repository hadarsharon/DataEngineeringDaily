<h1>Report: Large Coursework</h1>
<h1>HADAR SHARON</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
    My website is called <strong>Data Engineering Daily</strong>, and as the name suggests - it is aimed at Data
    Engineering enthusiasts with any of the following ideas in mind:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Following news and releases related to Data Engineering and/or Open Source technologies</li>
    <li>Learning new things about Data Engineering, or reinforcing existing knowledge & skills</li>
    <li>Discussing Data Engineering-related topics, questions, ideas etc. in the Website's forum</li>
    <li>Subscribing to the website for a daily newsletter/digest, so that one is always up to date</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The idea came to me while contemplating the site's theme, as I am a Data Engineer by trade.<br>
    I figured that if I do Data Engineering every day, it is probably the topic I'd be most comfortable with.<br>
    It was also very important for me to add a lot of relevant original content made entirely by me, and I can say
    that it was an interesting experience for me coming up with such.
</p>
<p>
    I chose to implement a homepage-heavy website, where most of the content and interesting stuff happen in the home
    page.<br>That is because I believe that a website's home page should be eye-catching and engaging, so that the user
    would like to spend more time in the website and explore it.<br>If the home page is bland or off-putting - the user
    might as well assume the rest of the pages are just as bland and won't take the time to explore the website, instead
    opting for more eye-catching ones.<br>
    I also made sure that a lot of the elements are clickable or interactive - links, videos, images etc.
</p>
<p>
    Despite that, I think the website is very clearly sectioned and there is quite a lot of space for all the elements
    to fit together. <br>I made it with the intention for it not to be cramped and overwhelming, but open and flowing.
</p>
<br>
<h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website:</h2>
<p>
    When creating my website, I was inspired by the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Local news sites that I visit on a daily basis</b> - I thought that the fact I come back to these specific
        sites means there is something about their design & layout that clicks with me.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Code/Frameworks/Modules/Libraries documentation sites</b> - Funnily enough, I spend a lot of time reading
        documentation, and a lot of the style and layout is similar in these.<br>I thought that I surely I am not the
        only one who is used to that style, and that it might fit the theme of the website perfectly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The Midterm Group Project</b> - Although the Midterm Group project was not nearly as detailed as this
        one,<br>
        I think that I learned a from it and took away two parallel notions from it:
        <ul>
            <li>What did we do well - and how I can apply these things in this project as well</li>
            <li>What we did NOT do well - and how I can learn from our mistakes and avoid them in this project</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible:</h2>
<p>My website is accessible in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Almost every img element has an appropriate 'alt' attribute</b>, so that sight-impaired visitors would not be<br>
        left wondering what these elements represent and what their goal in the page is
    </li>
    <li>
        Although not directly implemented by me but rather vicariously - <b>the embedded YouTube videos contain a
        built-in "Subtitles" feature</b>, as well as automatic Subtitles generation (at one's discretion) provided by
        YouTube.<br>This would allow hearing-impaired visitors to watch the embedded videos with ease.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The text and visual aspects of my website are styled in a very bold and clear theme</b> - large fonts, very
        colorful etc.<br>This would make it easier for older audience to interact with the site, as it is quite
        predictable and straightforward, without many hidden or unxpected quirks.
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site:</h2>
<p>I considered usability in the following contexts:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Interactive elements are intuitive and "inviting"</b> - i.e. there are buttons involved in almost all
        clickable elements, arrows for slideshows, play button for videos etc.
    </li>
    <li><b>Dynamic use of font size and horizontal rules</b> - Every section has an appropriate header that separates
        the content from the section within which its contained,<br>Horizontal rules separate the sections and create a
        clear visual border between different areas of the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Using Borders and Modals</b> - Border clearly define where the content starts and where it ends, while Modals
        pop up and display ONLY the relevant content, ONLY when asked to (e.g. at button click).
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
    how you did that</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Element Animations</b> - for my website to be interactive and engaging, I had to find out how to implement
        animations and transitions (e.g. slideshow).<br>I went through some online guides on the subject and also looked
        at a lot of example code until I understood what I like more and what I'd rather not use.<br>It was also
        important to me to keep things relatively simple and implement everything myself, so as to not use other
        people's code, especially if I don't understand it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Handlebars templating</b> - Since my website has a lot of original content, and I do not have access to a Web
        Server, I had to make use of a client-side templating engine such as Handlebars.<br>
        although we were introduced to Handlebars during the semester, I did not remember
        all of its nuts and bolts and had to go back to the lectures.<br>Of course, I also went over the API reference
        and examples provided in the Handlebars website.<br>
        This was crucial for me, as hard-coding all of my original content without the help of Handlebars would have
        made the HTML code very verbose and bloated.
    </li>
    <li><b>Bootstrap and jQuery</b> - It is my opinion that I am not good with CSS, therefore any framework that could
        help me structure my webpages as intended is a blessing.<br>I chose Bootstrap because it is intuitive and
        usable, and it helped me create the structure I needed without writing a lot of boilerplate CSS.<br>It also
        helped me implement responsiveness in my website.<br>
        As for jQuery - it helped me cut down on the amount of JavaScript I had to write, and had a lot of useful
        methods that helped me make my site more entertaining and interactive with less code.
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>
<p>
    I think that the website's HTML is relatively well-structured and that its JavaScript code is concise and efficient.<br>
    The website loads rather quickly and feels natural and fast to navigate around, which is important for every
    site.<br>
    Given that I wrote most of the content myself, I feel that the website feels authentic and relevant, without almost
    any placeholders or lorem ipsum-style content.<br>
    I especially like the "Quizzes" section, as it was fun for me to come up with the questions and I think it is the
    most enjoyable part of the site.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
    another time?</h2>
<p>
    As stated earlier, I definitely feel that, out of the 3 languages used in this project (HTML, CSS, JS), I am by far
    the least comfortable with CSS.<br>I have a feeling that this might be reflected in the website, both in terms of
    responsiveness and perhaps also in the quality of the CSS code.<br>Of course, I did my best, however if there's any
    specific area I'd like to improve on is CSS, responsiveness and styling.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What resources were used when creating your work?</h2>
<p>I used the following resources:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap 4 </a>(Used for Grid and
        Structure)
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery </a>(Used for JavaScript functions and event handlers)</li>
    <li><a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.js </a>(Used as a templating engine for embedding original
        content
        in HTML)
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome </a>(Used for eye-catching icons such as Social Media icons at
        the footer)
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools </a>(Used mostly for reference and tutorials, but no code copied
        or re-used except for the "Login" popup modal, which was used as a template and modified by me.
    </li>
    <li>
        All non-original content is open source and taken from either free Google results (Shutterstock and similar free
        website) or directly from the Open Source project's respective website, for example <a
            href="https://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-two-point-oh-is-here/">the
        release notes for Apache Airflow 2.0</a>
    </li>
</ul>
