                        <p>
                            Pkg is a complete rewrite of Julia's old package manager[1] and was released together
                            with
                            Julia v1.0. Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single
                            global
                            set of packages, Pkg is designed around “environments”: independent sets of packages
                            that
                            can be local to an individual project or shared and selected by name. The exact set of
                            packages and versions in an environment is captured in a manifest file which can be
                            checked
                            into a project repository and tracked in version control, significantly improving
                            reproducibility of projects. If you’ve ever tried to run code you haven’t used in a
                            while
                            only to find that you can’t get anything to work because you’ve updated or uninstalled
                            some
                            of the packages your project was using, you’ll understand the motivation for this
                            approach.
                            In Pkg, since each project maintains its own independent set of package versions, you’ll
                            never have this problem again. Moreover, if you check out a project on a new system, you
                            can
                            simply materialize the environment described by its manifest file and immediately be up
                            and
                            running with a known-good set of dependencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since environments are managed and updated independently from each other, “dependency
                            hell”
                            is significantly alleviated in Pkg. If you want to use the latest and greatest version
                            of
                            some package in a new project but you’re stuck on an older version in a different
                            project,
                            that’s no problem – since they have separate environments they can just use different
                            versions, which are both installed at the same time in different locations on your
                            system.
                            The location of each package version is canonical, so when environments use the same
                            versions of packages, they can share installations, avoiding unnecessary duplication of
                            the
                            package. Old package versions that are no longer used by any environments are
                            periodically
                            “garbage collected” by the package manager.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pkg’s approach to local environments may be familiar to people who have used Python’s
                            virtualenv or Ruby’s bundler. In Julia, instead of hacking the language’s code loading
                            mechanisms to support environments, we have the benefit that Julia natively understands
                            them. In addition, Julia environments are “stackable”: you can overlay one environment
                            with
                            another and thereby have access to additional packages outside of the primary
                            environment.
                            This makes it easy to work on a project, which provides the primary environment, while
                            still
                            having access from the REPL to all your usual dev tools like profilers, debuggers, and
                            so
                            on, just by having an environment including these dev tools later in the load path.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Last but not least, Pkg is designed to support federated package registries. This means
                            that
                            it allows multiple registries managed by different parties to interact seamlessly. In
                            particular, this includes private registries which can live behind corporate firewalls.
                            You
                            can install and update your own packages from a private registry with exactly the same
                            tools
                            and workflows that you use to install and manage official Julia packages. If you
                            urgently
                            need to apply a hotfix for a public package that’s critical to your company’s product,
                            you
                            can tag a private version of it in your company’s internal registry and get a fix to
                            your
                            developers and ops teams quickly and easily without having to wait for an upstream patch
                            to
                            be accepted and published. Once an official fix is published, however, you can just
                            upgrade
                            your dependencies and you'll be back on an official release again.
